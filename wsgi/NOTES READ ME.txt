Notes:

app/templates/base.html

--line 55, user nickname shortcode used for the dropdown on top right of page... BUT A FEW THINGS... 
must add if/else if they're logged in, shows name, if not it shows "log in", 
also if they're logged in the drop down settings that appear currently appear, 
if they're logged out, there is no dropdown, it's just a link to the login page. 
Also, I would like the full name to be displayed, not nickname here.
